## BlackJack Project

### Skill Distillery Week 4 Homework

#### Description
This is a BlackJack simulator where the player is automatically dealt two cards. They can choose to hit and receive another card, or stay. If their hand has a total value of 21, they automatically win. If that value is over 21, they lose. Otherwise, the dealer gets more cards until their hand value is over 16. Unless the dealer goes over 21, the two hands are compared. The highest hand wins, or in the event they are equal, the game ends in a tie. The game and program are over when someone wins, loses, or if it results in a tie.

####Technologies Used
* GitHub
* Eclipse
* Java

####Lessons Learned
* How to utilize enumerated data types
* Breaking down the functionality of the program (in this case, the game Blackjack), into words - especially objects and verbs - is extremely useful when trying to 		figure out what classes, interfaces, methods, etc. your project needs.
* UML maps are helpful in visualizing this functionality and therefore also helpful when structuring and writing the program.
